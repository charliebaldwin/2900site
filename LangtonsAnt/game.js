PS.init( system, options )
Called once after engine is initialized but before event-polling begins.
This function doesn't have to do anything, although initializing the grid dimensions with PS.gridSize() is recommended.
If PS.grid() is not called, the default grid dimensions (8 x 8 beads) are applied.
Any value returned is ignored.
[system : Object] = A JavaScript object containing engine and host platform information properties; see API documentation for details.
[options : Object] = A JavaScript object with optional data properties; see API documentation for details.
